Tutorial how to efficiently fix a production issue.

The issue in question is a rounding error in the method
`de.pdark.tutorial.hotfix.base.Order.collectOrder(User, long)`

`de.pdark.tutorial.hotfix.base` contains the code with the bug,
`de.pdark.tutorial.hotfix.commit*` contains each git "commit".

This makes it more efficient for me to write the tutorial.
In the real world, everything would happen in
`de.pdark.tutorial.hotfix.base`.
